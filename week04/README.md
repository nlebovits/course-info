## Agenda

- Libraries we'll use
  - Leaflet for mapping
  - [PapaParse](https://www.papaparse.com/) for CSV
  - Core JavaScript stuff (like `JSON` and `Math`)
- Loading JS libraries (from HTML, and from JS as modules)

## Exercises

* **Complete another ~28 (or more) exercises in the [Basic JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#basic-javascript) course on FreeCodeCamp**

  We should be through the entire Basic JavaScript section (113 exercises in all) by week 4, so that comes out to around 28 exercises per week. If you can get more done, it will just make it easier down the line.
