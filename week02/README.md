## Exercises

* **Complete another ~28 (or more) exercises in the [Basic JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#basic-javascript) course on FreeCodeCamp**

  We should be through the entire Basic JavaScript section (113 exercises in all) by week 4, so that comes out to around 28 exercises per week. If you can get more done, it will just make it easier down the line.

* **Go through the [Cat Photo App](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/#learn-html-by-building-a-cat-photo-app) project on FreeCodeCamp**

  This project provides good practice in using a subset of the many tags that are available in HTML.
