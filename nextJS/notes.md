## Notes

### React Core Concepts
Three core concepts to begin with:
- Components: smaller pieces of UI (modular). Can be updated without updating other components. Just regular JS.
- Props: props are like regular JS attributes. Can be passed to React components to update them dynamically. (props:components as attributes:elements)
- State: any information in your UI that changes over time, usually triggered by user interaction

React components should be capitalized to distinguish them from plain HTML and JS.
Also need angle brackets to tag them like with HTML.

Can nest React components like regular HTML elements

When writing JSX, using curly braces allows us to write any JS expression.
